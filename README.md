# Obsidian Link Converter Plugin

## 📕 Brief Explanation

This plugin helps you to scan all your links in the vault and convert them to `WikiLinks` or `Markdown` format.

### Commands

Once the plugin is loaded, 4 different commands are added to the available commands:

1. Convert all links in your `Vault`:

    - To `Markdown` Format
    - To `WikiLinks` Format

2. Convert only links in `Active File`:

    - To `Markdown` Format
    - To `WikiLinks` Format

Additionally, the plugin adds Link converter option to the `Context Menu` of `Markdown Files`:

In case you don't want `Context Menu` items, you can simply turn them off from the plugin settings.

### Final Link Format

You can also select the final format of the conversions as either "Relative Path" or "Absolute Path". Or you can simply select "Do not Change" to not make any changes to the final link formats.
